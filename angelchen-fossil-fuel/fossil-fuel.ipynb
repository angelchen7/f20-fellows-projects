    "In this lab, you will be investigating monthly fossil fuel consumption in the United States from January 2001 to July 2020 using a time series dataframe from pandas! Time series data consists of a series of observations recorded in time, where the order of the observations is crucial because they're dependent. In our case, we want to investigate monthly fossil fuel consumption because we want to know if the COVID-19 lockdown affected people's decisions to consume/use fossil fuels and how much effect it had over the months. For example, since the lockdown, people may feel scared to drive outside and thus, use less fuel. \n",

Right, this is because \"13\" here stands for the entire year. The EIA did not record monthly total fossil fuel consumption for 1949, they only recorded the annual consumption for that year.
